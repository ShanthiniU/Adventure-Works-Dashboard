# Business Problem

The goal of this project was to provide a robust analytics solution for the "Adventure Works" sales team. The business needed a way to move beyond static reports to a dynamic dashboard that could answer critical questions about sales performance, customer behavior, and product profitability.

# Key Questions
This dashboard was designed to answer the following key questions:

1. What are our overall sales, profit, and order trends over time?

2. Which products and categories are the most profitable?

3. Where are our top-performing sales regions globally?

4. What are the demographics of our most valuable customers?

5. How can we identify and track product performance against targets?

# Business Impact & Key Insights
By using this dashboard, the business can make data-driven decisions that directly impact performance and strategy. The project provides actionable insights such as:

1. Performance Monitoring: The executive dashboard provides a real-time view of sales against targets, allowing for proactive adjustments to strategy.

2. Customer Segmentation: Analysis of customer demographics helps in tailoring marketing campaigns and personalizing customer experiences, which can increase retention and lifetime value.

3. Operational Efficiency: Identifying top-selling products and understanding regional performance can optimize inventory management and resource allocation, leading to cost savings and increased profitability.

4. Strategic Planning: The insights gained from analyzing sales trends and customer behavior can inform future business strategies, from product development to market expansion.

# Technologies Used
Microsoft Power BI Desktop: Used for all data transformation, modeling, and visualization.

Power Query (M Language): For data cleaning and shaping.

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For creating custom measures and calculated columns to derive key performance indicators.

# Dashboard Breakdown
The project consists of four interactive dashboards, each providing a different level of insight into the business.

**1. Executive Dashboard**

This dashboard provides a high-level overview of the company's performance. It features key metrics like total revenue, profit, and orders, along with trends over time. A visual breakdown of orders by product category and a list of top-selling products help identify business strengths at a glance.

**2. Product Detail Dashboard**

This page allows for a deep dive into individual products. Users can select a specific product to view its performance against set targets for orders, revenue, and profit. This dashboard highlights the ability to create dynamic, single-product analysis views.

**3. Customer Detail Dashboard**

This dashboard focuses on customer-level analysis. It provides insights into the total number of unique customers and revenue per customer. Visualizations break down orders by income level and occupation, and a list of top customers by orders and revenue helps in identifying valuable customer segments.

**4. Geographic Map**

This map visualizes sales and customer data across different geographic regions, including North America, Europe, and the Pacific. It highlights the business's global reach and helps in understanding regional performance, identifying top-selling countries, and targeting marketing efforts.
